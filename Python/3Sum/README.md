**Problem:** Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
             
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


**Example:** 
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
 ```
 ```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: []
```
