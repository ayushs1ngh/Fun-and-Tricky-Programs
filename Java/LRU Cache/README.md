Problem: LRU cache

Initialize the LRUCache class:
	Capacity: Defines the capacity of the LRUCache
	get(key): Returns the value if the key is present, else returns -1
	put(key,value): If the capacity has been reached for the LRUCache, 
			we remove the least recently used from the cache. If the key exists, 
			then update the value in the cache.
